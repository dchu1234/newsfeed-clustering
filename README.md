# newsfeed-clustering
Purpose: For current events, a lot of different news channels and outlets cover the event, and this leads to an abundance of repetitive articles. This project is using R to do unsupervised machine learning clustering on news articles to group them under similar topics allowing for easier readability and accessability. 

Dataset: We hope to find a data that will have many news articles from different channels, that include the channel, the title, the date, the category of the article, location, other keywords.
